<h1>Bill Risher - <em>@billrisher</em></h1>
<p>Hey there, my name is Bill and I'm a believer in a free and open internet.
I think that information should be accessible by everyone and shouldn't be kept hidden.
We all stand on the shoulders of giants, and everyone should be able to enjoy the view.</p>
